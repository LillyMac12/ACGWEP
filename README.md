An Analysis and Comparison of Gravitational Wave Event Parameters --  Science Fair 2025.
<br>
This covers plotting the event, finding the power spectral density (PSD), the waveform modeling process, finding the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and plotting a spectrogram of the event. Does simple pyCBC inference to find the distance (Mpc) of each event.
